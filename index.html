    <p><q>Online learning is not the next big thing, it is the now big thing</q> by Donna J. Abernathy</p>

<h3><u>Flexible schedule and environment</u></h3>
<p>I can set up <mark>my own time</mark> to truly study at place that I am <mark>comfortable</mark> which is my bedroom.</p>

<h3><u>Save cost</u></h3>
<p>This is definitely true because I did <mark>not need to print out materials</mark> as I just submit it through <br> online medium such as google classroom, email and etc.</p>

<h3><u>I can review course material repeatedly</u></h3>
<p>For example, I can <mark>rewind</mark> the video content as much as I want until I truly understand it.</p>

<h3><u><del>Deadline</del> Develop self-discipline</u></h3>
<p>Without the commitment to attend physical class, I <mark>need to manage</mark> my time and tasks together.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.nst.com.my/education/2020/04/586565/uitm-moves-online-learning-mode">UiTM Institute of Continuing Education and Professional Studies chief executive officer Professor Dr Azizul Halim Yahya, who is leading the shift to ODL, said all academic activities conducted are a blend of asynchronous (without real-time interaction) and synchronous (real-time interaction) online learning.
